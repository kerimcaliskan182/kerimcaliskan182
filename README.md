## Embedded Systems Projects

### 1. Embedded Systems Experience with Linux and MCU Programming
I have worked extensively with **Linux OS** and various communication protocols such as **UDP** and **TCP**. I have also written firmware for **microcontroller units (MCUs)**, handling communication, real-time data processing, and low-level hardware interactions.

**Key Contributions**:
- Developed and optimized communication protocols using **UDP/TCP** for embedded systems to ensure efficient real-time data transfer.
- Wrote and tested firmware for MCUs, focusing on low-level hardware programming and real-time system requirements.
- Worked in **Linux** environments to manage, debug, and optimize embedded system applications.

### 2. Firmware Development
I developed firmware for **sensors** using **Mbed OS 6**, focusing on reliable and efficient operation. This involved embedded programming in **C++** and optimizing sensor performance for real-time applications.

**Key Contributions**:
- Designed and implemented firmware to enhance sensor data collection and processing.
- Improved system reliability and responsiveness through embedded software optimization.
- Collaborated with hardware teams to integrate software solutions into the sensor platform.
